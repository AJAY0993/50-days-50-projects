# Project 5: Background Blurring Effect with Loading Progress


![project-demo](https://github.com/AJAY0993/50-days-50-projects/assets/128742355/7c7b6b55-5bd4-493c-aec7-a1ef1073bf87)

This is the readme file for my fifth project from the "50 Days 50 Projects" challenge. In this project, I created a simple webpage that showcases a background blurring effect with a loading progress display. The effect gradually blurs the background image and updates the loading progress as it reaches completion.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to create an eye-catching webpage that demonstrates a background blurring effect while indicating the loading progress. The background image is initially sharp and becomes increasingly blurred as the loading progresses from 0% to 100%. The loading percentage is displayed at the center of the screen, and the entire page is designed to be responsive.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- `index.html`: This HTML file defines the basic structure of the webpage. It includes a background section with a dynamic blur effect and a loading progress display.

- `style.css`: The CSS file contains styling rules for the various components of the webpage, including the background image, loading text, and layout adjustments.

- `main.js`: This JavaScript file handles the loading progress and background blur effect. It calculates the blur intensity based on the loading progress and updates the loading percentage on the screen.

## How to Use

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder and navigate to the `index.html` file.
3. Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in a web browser.
4. You should see the webpage with the background blurring effect and the loading progress display.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different background images, blur intensities, or loading progress values to customize the visual effect.
