# Project 4: Search Bar Animation

Welcome to the repository for Project 4 of my "50 Days of Projects" challenge. In this project, I've created an interactive search bar with CSS animations and JavaScript interactivity. The search bar expands smoothly when clicked and contracts when the search is dismissed. Let's dive into the details!

## Project Overview

This project features a search bar with an elegant animation effect. The search input field and the search button are initially compact. However, upon clicking the button, the search bar smoothly expands to reveal a larger input field, providing a more user-friendly space for entering search queries.

## Features

- Interactive Search Bar: The search bar is designed to expand and contract smoothly with the help of CSS transitions and JavaScript interactivity.
- Focus Control: When the search button is clicked, the input field gains focus automatically, allowing users to start typing immediately.
- Stylish Design: The search bar features a clean and modern design with rounded corners and a background color transition.
- Background Gradient: The background of the entire page showcases a beautiful gradient that adds to the visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the search bar and the HTML layout of the page.
- CSS: Styling and animations of the search bar and background gradient.
- JavaScript: Interaction and animation logic for the expanding search bar.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the project in action.
3. Click on the search button to activate the expanding search bar.
4. Begin typing in the input field once it expands. Click the button again to dismiss the search bar.
