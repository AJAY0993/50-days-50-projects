## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **HTML File (`index.html`)**: This is the main HTML file that structures the web page. It includes the container for the background slider, left and right arrow buttons, and links to external stylesheets and JavaScript files.

- **CSS Files (`css/normalize.css` and `css/style.css`)**: These CSS files contain styles for normalizing browser rendering and custom styling for the web page elements.

- **JavaScript File (`js/main.js`)**: This JavaScript file contains the logic for cycling through background images and updating the web page's appearance. It listens for click events on the left and right arrow buttons and handles background image changes.

- **Images (`imagecompressor/`)**: This directory contains the background images used in the slider. You can replace these images with your own to customize the slider's content.

## Getting Started

To use the Background Slider on your website, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Customize the background images:
   - Replace the images in the `imagecompressor/` directory with your own images. Make sure they have similar filenames.
   
3. Customize the web page content (optional):
   - Modify the HTML structure in `index.html` to match your website's layout and add any additional content you need.
   
4. Link external resources:
   - If you have specific fonts or external libraries you want to use, modify the links in the `<head>` section of `index.html`.

5. Test locally:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to test the Background Slider on your local machine.
